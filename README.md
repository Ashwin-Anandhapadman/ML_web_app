This Machine learning-based web interface is used for calculating the Fire weather index (FWI) in case of forest fires. The model was trained using the Algerian forest fires dataset. 
I made this project to learn more advanced implementations of ML algorithms in real-world cases using frameworks such as Flask.I would like to thank popular ML tutor Krish Naik for his lessons on the same.

ABOUT:
The dataset consists of 244 instances from two regions in Algeria, namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-Abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria. 
There are 122 instances for each region, covering the period from June 2012 to September 2012. The dataset includes 11 attributes and 1 output attribute (class). 
The 244 instances have been classified into two classes: fire (138 instances) and not fire (106 instances).
